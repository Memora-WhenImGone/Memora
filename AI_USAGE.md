## AI & Research Acknowledgment

During the brainstorming phase for implementing encryption and decryption logic, I had extensive technical discussions with ChatGPT.

The utility functions used for generating and wrapping the Data Encryption Key (DEK) were developed through:

- Iterative conversations with ChatGPT
- Research and technical exploration
- Watching relevant YouTube tutorials
- Reviewing official documentation

The final implementation was carefully reviewed, tested, and refined before integration.

## Recorded Prompts & Research Topics

Below are some of the prompts and topics explored during development:

- Explain `wrapDEK` and `decode`
- How to proceed with AWS EventBridge
- Latest `libsodium` usage in Next.js
- What is a nonce?
- Asked for a more readable alternative to Node's native `crypto` library
- RSA-2048 key pair generation
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- RSA-OAEP for wrapping DEK
- SHA-256 fingerprint generation
