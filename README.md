## Getting Started
As we know, deployments are automated to Vercel, but we should always push our code to the development branch first because there may be build errors.

From the development branch, create your own branch and then open a pull request. Vercel will run the build, and if it succeeds, the changes can be merged into development.

We will only merge to main after careful consideration.
